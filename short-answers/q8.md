# Question

When we say "use semantic elements," what does that mean?

Please be sure to give an example of a semantic and non-semantic element in your explanation.

# Answer

A semantic element is one that clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and developer reading the code.
Not only is it more readable but it is easier to access and maintain.

non-semantic tags do not clearly convey the purpose for which they are being used.
Examples being using `div` or `span`or variables like `var1` `var2`. These tags can lead to confusion as only the person creating the code could understand. Basically the direct opposite of all the pro's of a semantic element.




An comparison could be drawn with how we Initialize a variable with a name that clearly relates to what it will hold.
