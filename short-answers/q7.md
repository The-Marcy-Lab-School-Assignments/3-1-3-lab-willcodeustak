# Question

What are at least 2 benefits to using:

```html
<script type="module" src="index.js"></script>
```

Instead of:

```html
<script src="index.js"></script>
```

# Answer
1. Easily label said script to be identifiable "type" -  specify what the script should be treated as. Decreases room for error.

2.  asynchronous is primarily associated with scripts loaded with type="module"

  - scripts without type="module" are used traditionally  meaning they execute one by one in the order they appear in the html. Which can lead to blockage.

- by being async type module's encapsulation allows for parallel loading with other resources.

encapsulation - Modules hold variables and functions within their own scope in separate files.
