# Question

What is the danger behind inserting user entered information *directly* into the DOM unescaped?

# Answer
Security risks and improper rendering of content.

- user entered content can be executed yb the browser when rendered
- HTML injections can alter the webpage ,redirecting users or manipulating content.
- instead of < " > etc because they are used in actual code we use these HTML entities to "substitute" > " < etc so it does not get run as code.

Characters overlap because HTML has specific meanings for characters normally used in programming language, therefore we use HTML entities in order to represent those characters in a safe manner. aka escaped.
