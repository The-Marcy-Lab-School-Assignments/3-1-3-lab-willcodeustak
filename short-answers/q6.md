# Question

What does `element.append()` do? What is an advantage it has over `element.appendChild()`?

# Answer
`element.append()` covers a more broad spectrum , - more versatile with its ability to accept multiple arguments and different types of inputs.

meanwhile `element.appendChild()` just appends a single element node `(<div> , <p> , <span>)`. aka only accepts one argument which is the node you want to append.
