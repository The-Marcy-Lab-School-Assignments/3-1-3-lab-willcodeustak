# Question

What is the primary difference between an HTTP GET request and an HTTP Post request?

# Answer
Primary difference is the security? or that GET requests information while POST submits data to be processed


- GET request

"The term "safe" in the context of HTTP methods refers to the method's effect on server state, not to data security."

The GET request appends data to the url which is not what we want to do when dealing with secure information. It is more fit for things like search boxes , say you look up "cute cat"; having "cute cat" at the end of your url would allow users to have the option of accessing specific areas of the page through the keyword.

GET is always a "safe" method because it does not alter the server state.

Get has a limit of 2048 characters (that sounds suspiciously like the game 2048)


----

- POST request

has no size limit on transmitted data.

Unsafe : Post is when we are submitting data tot he server often causing changes (creating ,updating or deleting- CRUD)
. AKA it is unsafe because it modify's the server state.
